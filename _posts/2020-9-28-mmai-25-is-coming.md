This year will also be our first competition done entirely online. Meaning you can stay safe and compete from the comfort of your own home!

To replace the game room this year we will also be hosting side competitions in various games that will be announced throughout the competition. Your opponents AI may be crushing yours but hey at least you beat them in Rocket League!
