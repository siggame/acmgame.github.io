        Tradebot Systems is a broker-dealer that trades
        stock for its own account.  Some days, we account
        for 5% to 10% of all stock trading in America.  We
        trade our own money and do not have customers.

        High Frequency Trading (HFT) is one of the most
        technically demanding applications.  We are always
        upgrading to the latest hardware.  Our stock
        trading system is one of the best in the world.
        When market data changes, our system can react and
        make new orders in nanoseconds.  Our decisions are
        based on analyzing huge data sets to determine when
        we have a statistical edge.
