MegaMinerAI Competition Rules
=============================


Definitions
-----------

The following terms are used in this document:

- **ACM**: ACM refers to Missouri S&T’s local chapter of the
  Association of Computing Machinery. It is a Recognized Student
  Organization (RSO) at Missouri S&T.
- **ACM-Game**: Missouri S&T ACM ACM-Game is a special interest group
  of Missouri S&T’s local chapter of ACM. Its purpose is to host
  MegaMinerAI once per semester. This includes logistics involved in
  hosting the competition, as well as development of software
  required to support it.
- **ACM-Game Developer**: A member of ACM-Game who was exposed to
  game-specific information for MegaMinerAI. ACM-Game maintains a
  list of people who have had access to this information. ACM-Game
  Developers are not eligible for any prizes.
- **Student Team**: A team comprised entirely of currently enrolled
  students. Each member may be either a full-time or a part-time
  student. Students may be enrolled at any accredited educational
  institution. MegaMinerAI is not limited to S&T students.
- **Non-student Team**: A team containing at least one member who is
  **not** enrolled as a full-time student or a part-time student.
- **ACM-Game Developer Team**: A team containing at least one member
  who is a ACM-Game Developer. These teams are not eligible for **any**
  prizes. However, Developers work hard to test MegaMinerAI, and often
  want to test their own AIs in the arena.

Venue
-----

MegaMinerAI is hosted on Missouri S&T’s campus in Rolla, Missouri.
Several rooms in Toomey Hall are reserved for competition. These
reserved rooms are considered the competition venue.

### Traveling Competitors

Competitors who intend to travel to Rolla to participate in MegaMinerAI
should notify ACM-Game as soon as possible. This will enable ACM-Game to
request enough temporary accounts for competitors. Additionally, S&T’s
IT department requires personal contact information from visitors to
enable network access for personal devices. If a visiting competitor
fails to inform ACM-Game of their travel plans, that competitor may be
unable to use S&T’s network to obtain Internet access.

Schedule and Phases of Competition
----------------------------------

All times are local (Central Time). Dinner on Saturday and breakfast
on Sunday are provided to competing teams that have paid their
registration fees. If lunch is provided on Sunday, that is also
provided to those teams.

Registration Fees
-----------------

- A registration fee of $24 per team will be collected at the end of
  the Opening Ceremony.
  - The registration fee is $24 per team regardless of team size.
  - Teams must pay their registration fees in cash.
- A team will receive a discount of $8 for each team member who is a
  dues-paying member of Missouri S&T’s ACM chapter, a student with a 
  valid student ID from a non-MST university, or bearing a free entry code.
  - For example, a team with exactly two member fulfilling the above criteria will
    receive a $16 discount. Thus, that team’s registration fee
    will be $8.
  - Discount eligibility will be determined according to S&T ACM’s
    official roster.
  - You *must* be a member of ACM at the time of competition to be
    eligible for a discount.
- Teams who do not pay the registration fee will be removed from the
  competition.
  - SIG-Game Developers will attempt to contact unpaid teams before
    removing them.

Teams
-----

- Teams must have at least one member and may not exceed three
  members.
- Teams must be formed on SIG-Game’s website prior to the start of the
  competition. All code submissions must be made through this site.
- Competitors without teams (free agents) will have an opportunity to form
  teams at the beginning of MegaMinerAI. SIG-Game will attempt to help
  freeagents find teams to join.
- Prize eligibility varies based on the status of team members. Please
  see the "Eligibility" section below.

Prizes
------

- Prizes are only awarded to eligible teams (see "Eligibility to win
  prizes").
- Prizes are awarded to *teams* not to individual members of a team.
  - It is the responsibility of a prize-winning team to decide how
    prizes should be divided among its members.
- Prizes from the Final Tournament are awarded as cash as follows:
  - First place: $500
  - Second place: $220
  - Third place: $120

Tournament
----------

### Submitting Code

- All code submissions must happen through SIG-Game’s website.
- All code must execute on an Ubuntu 14.04 Linux machine using the
  following restrictions
  - Makefiles
    - A GNU Makefile must be at the *top level* of the team’s
      repository
    - The makefile must able to successfully build the team’s
      program
  - run file
    - A Bash script named "run" must be at the *top level* of
      the team’s repository
    - Executing this script must start the team’s AI program
    - The script must allow for command line arguments to be
      passed to the compiled executable
- If a submitted program is not fully built by ``make`` and
  executable with ``run``, the AI may be ineligible for
  participation
  - For example, a team’s program may compile and run in Eclipse or
    Visual Studio, but if that program does not compile and run as
    described above, that AI will not be run in the final tournament
- Please note that the ShellAI provided to each competitor ***will
  successfully compile and run as described***. No changes are necessary
  to compile ShellAI. In most cases, the ``Makefile`` and ``run`` do
  not require modification to work with other AIs as well.
- Teams should ask SIG-Game Developers for help if necessary.

### Quick Draw Tournaments

  which team is currently in first place. A second Quick Draw
  Tournament may occur at 9:00 AM on Sunday

  - SIG-Game Developer Alumni
  - ACM / MegaMinerAI Sponsors

### Eligibility to win prizes

  - If a team has one or more non-student member, that team will be
    ineligible to win prizes in the Final Tournament.

Receiving Help
--------------

During the competition, Developers will be available to answer any
questions that competitors may have. If you, as a competitor, have any
questions, please ask them for help. All SIG-Game Developers can be
easily identified, as they will be wearing the T-Shirt for the current
MegaMinerAI.

Teams may use online resources and publicly available, open source
libraries to assist their AI. However, teams are not allowed to reuse
personal code or libraries specifically designed for AI / MegaMinerAI
development. All development must be done by members of that team
during competition hours


Cheating and Dishonesty
-----------------------

If a team is suspected of cheating or sabotaging SIG-Game, MegaMinerAI,
or another competing team, SIG-Game will revoke the eligibility of the
saboteur’s entire team and remove that team from the competition. The
final decision to remove a team from competition will be made by the
Chair of SIG-Game.

Please note that this does not include game strategies. For example, if
an AI is written to perform well against one particular opponent,
SIG-Game does not consider this sabotage. If, however, an AI was
designed to exploit security vulnerabilities in SIG-Game’s
infrastructure or an opponent’s code, SIG-Game would consider this
actionable sabotage.

### Examples of acceptable and unacceptable actions:

Please note that these are examples. If you have questions about other
actions, please contact SIG-Game.

#### Acceptable:

- Analyzing other teams strategy from watching games
- Asking another team about their strategy
  - If they volunteer that information, that's their decision.

#### Unacceptable:

- Exploiting security vulnerabilities
  - This includes (but is not limited to) network and memory
    exploits
- Excessive use of computing resources
  - Abusively consuming CPU, memory, disk space
- Stealing code from other teams

IP Terms and Conditions
-----------------------
At the beginning of the competition, all competitors are provided with base
code, which they then modify and add to for the purposes of the competition.

All modifications and additions to the base code made by competitors are
intellectual property, ownership of which is retained by the competitors.

By entering this competition, competitors agree to allow the use of their code
by the organizers of the competition for the duration of the competition,
exclusively for the purposes of competing the code against the work of other
competitors in the manner described in these rules.

Also, competitors agree by submitting code to this competition to allow the use
of their code by the organizers of this competition during and after the
competition, exclusively for the purposes of testing and refining infrastructure
maintained by SIG-Game. Competitors' code will not be used, in whole or in part,
for any other purpose after the duration of the competition.


Other Rules and Policies
